/**
 * Currently (as of Node v17.0.1) there are some serious issues w/ using
 * [ESM](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules).
 *
 * When a node module is marked as `"type": "module"` in `package.json`, and `tsconfig.json` is
 * updated w/ `compilerOptions` that generate ESM code (which means that `import` & `export` is
 * used instead of `module.exports` & `require`, then a lot of existing libraries like Jest
 * have issues loading their own TS config files correctly!
 *
 * These libraries tend to use `require` at their boot up sequence assuming their config files
 * are written in CJS (CommonJS modules) which then fails because we are using TS files which
 * are compiled to EJM (which means `require` can't be used). Yikes! ðŸ˜®
 *
 * This is a fantastic [issue in the jest repo]
 * (https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/11453#issuecomment-850977379) that gets to
 * the heart of what is going wrong. The issue is great and the comments are great, w/ the
 * `ts-jest` author chiming in. And a very simple workaround is provided there as well in a comment.
 *
 * TL;DR: These issues will be resolved as ESM support in Node.js and the ecosystem matures. And
 * for now, an effective workaround is to use a `cjs` file instead of a `ts` file for
 * `jest.config`. This bypasses our TS code generation to ESM altogether.
